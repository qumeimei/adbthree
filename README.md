Data

I just selected several data sheet according to following rules:
1.the constant is large enough, i.e., there is more than 1000 rows and the serious topic together should be more than 1000 rows.
2.I can understand the topic and have idea there should be at least one rules can be collected.

What should be done next:
1. Zheng Yu can review this data sheet and select the one you like most.
2. Jingyi Guo will then combine the topic and delete the contact we don not need. For example there is empty column.
